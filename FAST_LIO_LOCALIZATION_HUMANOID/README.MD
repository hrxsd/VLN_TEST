### 0.1 Modified livox_ros_driver2 for Unitree G1
**Livox MID360** on **Unitree G1** is upside down, the original **livox_ros_driver2** only allows modifying pointcloud extrinsics, not IMU. Our **modified livox_ros_driver2** can change both.

Left is original, pointcloud is upside down and gravity acceleration measured by the IMU is negative, right is our modified.

### 0.2 Robust localization based on offline pointcloud map

Our solution can handle **rough initial pose**, allows **robust localization**, and offline pointcloud map guarantee **no accumulated localization errors** caused by long hours of work(unlike common SLAM).

## 1. Prerequisites
### 1.1 Ubuntu and ROS
  * Ubuntu 18.04 for ROS Melodic
  * Ubuntu 20.04 for ROS Noetic
  
The following processes have been tested in a pure Ubuntu 20.04 virtual machine.
### 1.2. PCL & Eigen & C++
Install LLVM C++ Standard library by following command.
```
sudo apt install libc++-dev libc++abi-dev
```
For ROS Melodic and ROS Noetic, the default PCL and Eigen is enough.

Install Eigen by following command.
```
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
```

### 1.3. Open3D


Recommend use the precompiled Open3D library we provided. It can be downloaded from [Baidu Netdisk](link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1vTLXVYJ6JBlbhNpDf87Cdg?pwd=spdg pwd: spdg), ```open3d141.zip```(tested) can be used for x86 architecture and ```open3d141_arm.zip```(not fully tested) can be used for arm architecture. 

Open [open3d_loc/CMakeLists.txt](open3d_loc/CMakeLists.txt), replace ```Open3D_DIR``` by the folder where you unziped open3d141.zip.

```
#For example
set(Open3D_DIR "/home/liar/open3d141/lib/cmake/Open3D")
```
Or, build from source by yourself, follow the guidance of installation in the [Open3D documentation/Build from source](https://www.open3d.org/docs/release/compilation.html).

### 1.4 Livox-SDK2

Follow the guidance of installation in the [Livox-SDK2](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/Livox-SDK2)

### 1.5 Livox-SDK & livox_ros_driver (for fast_lio)

Since the fast_lio must support Livox serials LiDAR firstly, so the **livox_ros_driver** must be installed

Follow the guidance of installation in the [Livox-SDK](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/Livox-SDK) and [livox_ros_driver](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver)


## 2. Build
Source livox_ros_driver before build (for fast_lio).
```
#In the same terminal

#Source livox_ros_driver before every build
cd ~/ws_livox/
source devel/setup.bash

#The first build requires a new workspace
mkdir -p ~/ws_loc/src

#Get code
cd ~/ws_loc/src
git clone https://github.com/deepglint/FAST_LIO_LOCALIZATION_HUMANOID.git
cd ..

#Build
catkin_make -DROS_EDITION=ROS1
```

## 3. Parameter Configuration
### 3.1 livox_ros_driver2
Remember to modify your computer ip address, follow [G1 SDK Development Guide/Lidar Route](https://support.unitree.com/home/zh/G1_developer/lidar_Instructions).

If you need to adjust the extrinsics of the pointcloud and IMU, just modify the ```extrinsic_parameter``` in [livox_ros_driver2/config/MID360_config.json](livox_ros_driver2/config/MID360_config.json).
```
#For example, "roll" for reversed Livox MID360 on Unitree G1 is 180.0

    "lidar_configs" : [
    {
      "ip" : "192.168.123.120",
      "pcl_data_type" : 1,
      "pattern_mode" : 0,
      "extrinsic_parameter" : {
        "roll": 180.0,
        "pitch": 0.0,
        "yaw": 0.0,
        "x": 0,
        "y": 0,
        "z": 0
      }
    }
  ]
```
If you need to modify other parameters(such as ip), follow the [livox_ros_driver2](livox_ros_driver2/README.md)
### 3.2 fast_lio
The default parameter configuration is OK.

If you need to modify parameters, follow the [FAST_LIO](FAST_LIO/README.md).
### 3.3 open3d_loc
Place your pointcloud map in the [data](data) folder, and  change the ```path_map``` in [open3d_loc/launch/open3d_loc_g1.launch](open3d_loc/launch/open3d_loc_g1.launch) to your pointcloud map's location. Both ```.pcd``` and ```.ply``` formats are acceptable.
```
<param name="path_map" type="string" value="$(find open3d_loc)/../data/map.ply" />
```

 ```threshold_fitness_init``` is initial pointcloud registration threshold, ```threshold_fitness``` is regular pointcloud registration threshold. In different scenarios, the two thresholds may need to be tested and changed.

## 4. Run
### 4.0 pointcloud map
We do not provide specific mapping solutions, but recommend a few open-source mapping solutions, [FAST-LIO2](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO) and [Point-LIO](https://github.com/hku-mars/Point-LIO) is enough for small-scale scenarios.

Recommend [CloudCompare](https://github.com/CloudCompare/CloudCompare) to fine tune pointcloud maps, such as aligning the ground or cropping out people's shadows.

(If we can get 100 stars, we will urge other colleagues to simplify and open source our mapping solutions for large-scale scenarios)


### 4.1 open3d_loc & fast_lio
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch open3d_loc localization_3d_g1.launch
```
[open3d_loc/launch/localization_3d_g1.launch](open3d_loc/launch/localization_3d_g1.launch) starts ```open3d_loc``` and ```fast_lio``` at the same time.

```Rviz``` of fast_lio consumes some memory, so we disable ```rviz``` of ```fast_lio``` by default in [FAST_LIO/launch/mapping_mid360_g1.launch](FAST_LIO/launch/mapping_mid360_g1.launch)
```
<!-- <arg name="rviz" default="true" /> -->
<arg name="rviz" default="false" />
```

### 4.2 initial pose
In **rviz**, click **2D Pose Estimate**, and determine a position and orientation on the pointcloud map by **green arrow**.

<img src="doc/initial_pose.jpg" width=75% />
</div>

### 4.3 livox_ros_driver2
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch livox_ros_driver2 msg_MID360.launch
```

### 4.4 rosbag
If you need to run based on rosbag, do not need to roslaunch **livox_ros_driver2**.However, rosbag must also be collected using our **modified livox_ros_driver2**.

```
#For example
rosbag play xxx.bag
```

If you need to check the delay time, set ```use_sim_time``` to "true" in [FAST_LIO/launch/mapping_mid360_g1.launch](FAST_LIO/launch/mapping_mid360_g1.launch) and [open3d_loc/launch/open3d_loc_g1.launch](open3d_loc/launch/open3d_loc_g1.launch), then
```
#For example
rosbag play xxx.bag --clock
```

### 4.5 check by rqt_graph

Roslaunch the above node, in the newly opened terminal check by following command.

```
rqt_graph
```
The correct graph is as follows, this is the case with rosbag. If you use livox_ros_driver2 directly, ```/livox_lidar_publisher2``` will replace ```/play_xxx``` in the graph.

| /localization_3d_confidence | std_msgs/Float32          | pointcloud registration fitness, higher the value, the more accurate the localization |
| /localization_3d_delay_ms   | std_msgs/Float32          | delay time between localization result and odometry(from fast_lio), in milliseconds   |

Check rostopic by following command.
```
#The same to /localization_3d_confidence and /localization_3d_delay_ms
rostopic echo /localization_3d
```

The delay time is tested in a **150m * 50m * 30m** large-scale pointcloud map, and the delay time is basically less than 30ms. The computer used in the test has 15GB of memory, CPU is 11th Gen Intel® Core™ i5-11400H @ 2.70GHz × 12, and the system is 64-bit Ubuntu18.04

## 6. Demo
### 6.0 Rosbag for demo
Also can be downloaded from [Baidu Netdisk](link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1vTLXVYJ6JBlbhNpDf87Cdg?pwd=spdg pwd: spdg)

```mapping.bag``` is data for mapping, and ```loc.bag``` is data for positioning

### 6.1 Mapping
Use **fast_lio** to do mapping. 

Refer to [doc/demo_mapping_fastlio.mp4](doc/demo_mapping_fastlio.mp4).

### 6.2 Fine tune(Recommend)
Use **CloudCompare** to fine tune. Downsampling to reduce the size of the pointcloud map, align the ground plane, and try to ensure that the z-axis of the ground is 0.

Refer to [doc/demo_finetune.mp4](doc/demo_finetune.mp4).

### 6.2 Localizaiton
Refer to [doc/demo_loc.mp4](doc/demo_loc.mp4).
